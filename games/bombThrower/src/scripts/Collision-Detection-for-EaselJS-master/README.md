Pixel Perfect and BoundingBox Collision Detector for EaselJS Bitmaps and BitmapAnimations

## Namespace

The default namespace is 'ndgmr':
To check for a collision between to Bitmaps and/or BitmapAnimations

## Example: Rectangular / BoundingBox Collision
	var intersection = ndgmr.checkRectCollision(bitmap1,bitmap2);
	// intersection is null if no collision, otherwise a {x,y,width,height}-Object is returned

## Pixel Perfect Collision Example
	var collision = ndgmr.checkPixelCollision(bitmap1,bitmap2,alphaThreshold,true);
	// returns a rect with the global position of the colliding pixel(s)
	// alphaThreshold default is 0, set to higher value to ignore collisions with semi transparent pixels
	// the last parameter defines if all pixels should be checked, in this case it returns a
	// rect with the size of the full collision, if false a rect with the size 1x1 is returned

## Debugging
	// To add debug-output on page use:
	ndgmr.DEBUG_COLLISION = true;
	// OR
	ndgmr.DEBUG = true;
