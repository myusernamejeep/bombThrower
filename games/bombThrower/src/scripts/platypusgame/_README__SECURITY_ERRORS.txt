Most browsers (with the exception of Safari), will throw a security error if you run this content locally and click on the background. This is because EaselJS reads pixel data to determine what you clicked on, and most browsers donâ€™t allow pixel access on local images.

Run the content from a server, or temporarily disable local security in your browser to test.
